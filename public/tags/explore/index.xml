      <description>Budapest - February 2019
I could go on and on about Budapest, my favorite city in the world so far, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep it short-ish. We took the train from Vienna and travelling through the countryside, and well, it is pretty much what you&amp;rsquo;d imagine the Hungarian countryside to look like. Lots of nothing and the few towns and cities had a prevalent communism influence with un-maintained, large concrete buildings.</description>

      <description>Prague - February 2019
Prague is one of my all time favorite cities. I most recently went in February. While it was freezing, going to Europe in winter did have a couple of perks, the main being few other tourists. I had been to Prague in the Summer and not having to fight for a spot in front of the Clock Tower was nice to say the least. Another great aspect of Europe in Winter was how beautiful Prague is in the snow.</description>
