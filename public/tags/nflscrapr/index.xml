      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always heard &amp;ldquo;the team that commits the least amount of penalties wins the game.&amp;rdquo; It makes sense, but I wanted to dig deeper. Not every penalty is created equal, so which ones truly &amp;ldquo;penalize&amp;rdquo; the team chances of winning? How much impact does having less penalties than the opponent? Let&amp;rsquo;s find out.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the Win Probability Added (WPA) from penalties. This measures how much the win probability model from NFLScrapR increases or decreases after the penalty is committed.</description>

      <description>If I were to ask which types of throws Pat Mahomes was the best at in 2018, many would say the deep ball…or the no-look pass…or the left-handed pass…or any other ridiculous pass he made. Not many would think it was the short pass. Actually the shortest pass of all. The Chiefs were by far and away the best team when it came to passes at or behind the line of scrimmage.</description>

      <title>Where Teams are Most Conservative</title>

      <description>Everyone knows, or should know by now, that passing is more effective than running. This has been proven time and again. What I wanted to know was if teams tended to be more conservative by running the ball more often by field position. More specifically, where are teams running the ball more on third down and why. The below graph show yards to goal line broken down by distance to go over the past 5 years.</description>
