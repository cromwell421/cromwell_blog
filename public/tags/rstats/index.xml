      <description>Analytics is taking over football. That much I am sure about. This means we can expect new, innovative ways to coach and manage teams going forward.

Part of the many, many benefits of analytics taking over football is the ability for teams to optimize play calling and game planning strategies.</description>

      <description>If I were to ask which types of throws Pat Mahomes was the best at in 2018, many would say the deep ball…or the no-look pass…or the left-handed pass…or any other ridiculous pass he made. Not many would think it was the short pass. Actually the shortest pass of all. The Chiefs were by far and away the best team when it came to passes at or behind the line of scrimmage.</description>
