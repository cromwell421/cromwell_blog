      <description>Football is a game of knowing your opponent and taking advantage of mismatches. This is a big reason why players and coaches study film. Everyone has tendencies and identifying them before they happen in a game is a huge advantage. That is why I wanted to dive into offensive play-calling to highlight play-calling tendencies. Can we accurately predict if a team is going to run or pass purely on the game situation?</description>

      <description>Analytics is taking over football. That much I am sure about. This means we can expect new, innovative ways to coach and manage teams going forward. Panthers owner David Tepper has spoken about being innovative in his approach to filling the head coach role, but also his front office staff. Even ex-GB coach Mike McCarthy has re-branded himself as analytically-minded in hopes of getting a job in 2020. Part of the many, many benefits of analytics taking over football is the ability for teams to optimize play calling and game planning strategies.</description>

      <description>If I were to ask which types of throws Pat Mahomes was the best at in 2018, many would say the deep ball…or the no-look pass…or the left-handed pass…or any other ridiculous pass he made. Not many would think it was the short pass. Actually the shortest pass of all. The Chiefs were by far and away the best team when it came to passes at or behind the line of scrimmage.</description>
