      <description>If I were to ask which types of throws Pat Mahomes was the best at in 2018, many would say the deep ball…or the no-look pass…or the left-handed pass…or any other ridiculous pass he made. Not many would think it was the short pass. Actually the shortest pass of all. The Chiefs were by far and away the best team when it came to passes at or behind the line of scrimmage.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows, or should know by now, that passing is more effective than running. This has been proven time and again. What I wanted to know was if teams tended to be more conservative by running the ball more often by field position. More specifically, where are teams running the ball more on third down and why. The below graph show yards to goal line broken down by distance to go over the past 5 years.</description>

      <description>Prague - February 2019
Prague is one of my all time favorite cities. I most recently went in February. While it was freezing, going to Europe in winter did have a couple of perks, the main being few other tourists. I had been to Prague in the Summer and not having to fight for a spot in front of the Clock Tower was nice to say the least. Another great aspect of Europe in Winter was how beautiful Prague is in the snow.</description>
