<h2>How Airlines are Getting Creative During Covid-19</h2>
<p>By now, you may have heard of the coronavirus that is wreaking havoc of the world’s economy and has lead to over a million deaths worldwide. The seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be understated and people must adapt to overcome and eradicate the virus. Similarly, firms and industries are forced to be innovative in order to overcome the impactful storm caused by from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Perhaps no other industry has been impacted by COVID-19 more than the airline industry in 2020. Air traffic came to screeching halt in March with countries closing borders and stay-at-home orders being enacted across the globe within a few weeks time. While the US government provided airlines a $25 billion grant as part of the CARES act passed earlier this year, it would not be enough to keep airlines from massive layoffs nor ease the pain of high cash burns.</p>
<p>With low passenger counts and continuing operating costs, airlines have been burning through cash at a rate of millions of dollars per day since the start of the pandemic. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported that they expect airlines to <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-10-06-01/">burn through $77 billion in cash during the second half of 2020</a> and should continue into 2021. With that said, airlines are starting to get creative in their operations in order to limit the financial hemorrhage from COVID-19.</p>

<p>The first actions that airlines took were focused around health and safety of passengers. Airlines immediately put protocols into place with deep sanitation cleaning before and after each flight, mask mandates, and required social distancing, all of which follow new <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/air/managing-sick-travelers/ncov-airlines.html">CDC guidelines</a> for air travel. Some airlines even started using strong disinfectant fogging sprays to get a deeper, more effective clean of the airplane. These new mandates are meant to make air travel safer, but implementing new processes while efficiently operating can be a struggle. That is why one Brazilian airline, Azul, started using technology and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNCWLNrK-40&amp;feature=youtu.be">digital projections</a> to expedite passenger onboarding while remaining socially distant. Delta also changed its onboarding process to limit human interaction by allowing a small section of rows board at a time, starting with the back of the plane moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition to safety of their passengers, airlines are rethinking their revenue strategies and cost structures to ease the burden of COVID-19. Traditionally, airlines use yield management to price fares, but the pandemic has led them to mostly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/23/airfares-airlines-arent-raising-prices-amid-covid-19-pandemic.html">price for passenger volume</a>. Furthermore, airlines have revoked their change fees in order to win back travelers and ease people back into booking flights, all while trying to increase their cash on hand. Airlines are also strategically ramping up new seasonal routes. JetBlue recently launched new <a href="https://www-bizjournals-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2020/10/14/jetblue-adds-seasonal-flights-to-telluride-from-ny.amp.html">routes from New England to Colorado</a> ahead of its ski season, along with adding flights to the Caribbean to take advantage of a slowly increasing leisure travel crowd during the winter months.</p>
<p>With few to no passengers on many flights, airlines started leveraging the empty space normally filled with eager travelers by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/business/coronavirus-airlines-cargo-passengers.html">shipping cargo</a>. Passenger airlines usually only allocate a small portion of its hold for cargo, but now some planes are 100% cargo transports. United Airlines recently reported a near <a href="https://hub.united.com/2020-10-14-as-q3-ends-united-airlines-shifts-from-surviving-the-covid-19-crisis-to-positioning-to-lead-the-rebound-2648210545.html">50% increase of cargo revenue</a> in Q3 2020 compared to Q3 2019. Cargo revenues across the industry are expected to reach record levels for passenger airlines due to the increased volumes, increased demand, and higher shipping rates of goods during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In order to raise funds, airlines are starting to think outside-of-the-box. Delta recently announced it was collateralizing its frequent flier miles program, Skymiles, in order to borrow $6.5 billion in funds. It is not uncommon for airlines to collateralize assets like their fleet, but leveraging their loyalty programs brings another entire set of questions. The Financial Times estimates that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1bb94ed9-90de-4f15-aee0-3bf390b0f85e">Delta’s loyalty program is valued at $26 Billion</a>, well above its market cap. Considering people are still spending on their credit cards, Delta and other airlines have also considered <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/united-delta-weigh-selling-miles-early-to-raise-cash-in-coronavirus-crisis-11586779535">selling discounted miles to banks</a> in order to prop up their cash reserves.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are a few notably creative ideas from airline companies that have put some passengers’ needs to fly in action. Airlines in South Korea, Japan, and Australia are offering “flights to nowhere” with passengers <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-travelers-miss-flying-so-much-theyre-taking-planes-to-nowhere-11601227803">paying hundreds of dollars to take off and land at the same location.</a> One QANTAS flight sold out in 10 minutes! Singapore Airlines has created an upscale <a href="https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/plan-travel/discover-your-sia/restaurant-a380-at-changi/">restaurant onboard its largest airplane</a> for passengers to dine in coach and first class, without ever leaving the tarmac. Given that the dinner may only cost you $40, this will hardly help the airline rebound to normal revenue levels, but it will reignite the flame that avid travelers are missing - the feeling of escaping by plane.</p>
<p>Airline volumes may take years to return to normal levels and airlines have already downsized their workforces by tens of thousands of employees. The damage that the COVID-19 pandemic has done to the industry is unfathomable and we can only hope that the firms in the industry are able to survive it. Being innovative and creative is just a part of the long road to recovery.</p>
