**Prague - February 2019**

Prague is one of my all time favorite cities. I most recently went in February. While it was freezing, going to Europe in winter did have a couple of perks, the main being few other tourists. I had been to Prague in the Summer and not having to fight for a spot in front of the Clock Tower was nice to say the least. Another great aspect of Europe in Winter was how beautiful Prague is in the snow. The cobble-stoned streets, the snow covered roofs, it was truly incredible. 


**Favorite Food or Beverage Place** -- [Lokál U Bílé kuželky](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d1500679-Reviews-Lokal_U_Bile_Kuzelky-Prague_Bohemia.html) - Great food just outside the castle. Get there early and prepare to wait. I also recommend [U Sudu](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d819561-Reviews-U_Sudu-Prague_Bohemia.html) for drinks. It is an old wine cellar with 6 floors of underground bars.

**Favorite Touristy Thing:**  [The Astronomical Clock](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274707-d275152-Reviews-Old_Town_Hall_with_Astronomical_Clock-Prague_Bohemia.html) - Everyone knows about it, and there is always a crowd, but not many people know you can climb to the top of it. The entrance is off to the left and it costs about $2, but the 360 degree views of the entire city are 100% worth it. 

**Favorite Road Less Traveled Place:**  [Speculum Alchemiae](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274707-d4194102-Reviews-Speculum_Alchemiae_Museum-Prague_Bohemia.html) - This small, hidden museum is one of the oldest houses in Prague. During the tour, you learn all about alchemy and actually go down an underground tunnel beneath the streets of Prague where real alchemical laboratories from the 16th century were discovered. Another dark tourist thing to do while in Prague (you'll see a lot of these in my posts) was [Church of St. James](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274707-d284477-Reviews-Church_of_St_James-Prague_Bohemia.html). A beautiful baroque church with a rotted human arm hung from the rafters. I can't remember why it was there, but definitely unique church experience.
