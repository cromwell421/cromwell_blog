First of all, thanks you for coming to my page. This is the first website I've done and am very excited to share it with you all! I currently work in healthcare doing analytics and project management, as well as pursuing my MBA part-time. I'm an Atlanta native interested in all things sports, especially the Falcons and the NFL. As I am sure you may have noticed, I don't talk about much else other than NFL stats and travelling. 

My goal is to travel to every continent and see the Falcons win in every NFL stadium - a verrrry lofty goal I know, but 3 stadiums and 4 continents down so far.

Every picture you see was taken by me. I tend to go by the rule of quantity over quality when it come to picture taking and am by no means a great photographer. Either way, I like them and I hope they inspire you to travel as much as you can.
